# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi! I am a Master's student in the Natural Language Processing Department at **Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)**, supervised by [Prof. Xiuying Chen](https://iriscxy.github.io/). 

My research interests focus on **Large Language Models, AI Safety, and Cognitive Science in AI**. I am particularly interested in understanding how language models process emotions, reason across languages, and handle noisy inputs.

Prior to MBZUAI, I received my Bachelor's degree in **[your undergraduate major]** from **[your undergraduate university]**.
