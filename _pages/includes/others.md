# 👾 Miscellaneous

Outside research, I enjoy philosophy, history documentaries, and the writings of Borges. I like the calm and timeless way they invite me to think. After long nights in the lab, I often walk to Masdar Park near campus to watch the stars and think about those timeless questions: who we are, where we come from, and where we are going.

I also love traveling. I enjoy exploring cultural landscapes and getting a glimpse of everyday life, sitting in cafés where locals gather and imagining the world through their eyes. Sometimes it’s a Dutch herring sandwich by the canals in Amsterdam; sometimes it’s a Nutella kunafa in Abu Dhabi (my favorite, though my Arab friends insist it’s a crime against tradition).

These experiences have shaped my taste in research — I hope to do work that holds real value for humanity itself.
